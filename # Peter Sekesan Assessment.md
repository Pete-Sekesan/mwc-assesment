# Peter Sekesan Assessment 

## Question 1
- Please reference dates.js file for the solution. I had to look up some help in regards to using regex but I could not solve it any other way (other than using the Date parsing object.)

## Question 2
- To be honest, I did not have a lot of knowledge of this prior to this question. I did some research and from what I have gathered, the use of Linux Security Modules seems to be a great line of defense to stop attacks. For example, if you have a PHP site running on an Apache server and a vulnerability is discovered there, a properly deployed Linux Security Module would not allow an attacker to get further into a machines system
- Applying full disk encryption is anther step that can be taken, one I have used on my Mac for quite sometime now myself. 
- Disabling root login is another step that can be taken, and to use sudo when executing any commands.

## Question 3
- Please reference the index.html and style.css files. I want to make sure this is handed in on time, but I feel I could eventually get this spot on from the pdf. But there are certainly some spots here and there I'd like to adjust.

## Question 4
- In my boot camp program, almost all of React in addition to Node and PostgreSQL were taught using TDD. Now at the time, it was a bit maddening. I hated trying to learn a new skill but it seemed to come at a snail pace when you just wanted to see results. 
After learning that way, here are my thoughts:
I think it should be mandatory that your code can run in a test before it can ever run in an application. With that being said, whenever I begin working on a new project I don't write tests right away because the structure I am looking for changes quite often. When I am happy with an initial layout, I then write unit tests for it.
What I have come to like out of it, is it helps me pick up on bad coding habits I may have picked up in my learning and it makes me think ahead the next time.

## Question 5
- As far as a favorite quote, this one has gotten me by through my bootcamp and all other subsequent learning: "Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out.‚Äù - Chris Pine
 As far as some cartoons or memes, I always get a kick out of the following two:
